# open-embeddings
A lightweight, simple natural language search service, built on open source tools. Its designed to be simple to deploy and cheap to run.

This project is built using FastAPI, HuggingFace `sentence-transformers`, postgresql and uvicorn.

Deployed using Google Cloud and backed by Supabase.

## Getting started

This service is designed to be backed by a postgres database. You can use the provided `docker-compose` configuration provided to spin the service up locally, or you can bring your own postgres database using providers like Supabase. Supabase provides a free tier that includes a small postgres database, ideal for smaller projects.
